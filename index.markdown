# Vizir

    Disconnected from OAR job 960063

Ever been disconnected from Grid'5000 machines with a message like this one, losing part or all of your work?

Vizir is a simple Ruby script for [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) that monitors your interactive jobs on [Grid'5000](http://www.grid5000.fr/).
It triggers [Growl](http://growl.info/) notifications when your reservations are going to terminate, allowing you to save your work and/or your deployed environments.

## Usage

Simply run Vizir in the background, specifying your Grid'5000 login name with the <tt>--login</tt> switch.

    $ vizir --login priteau &

By default, Vizir triggers a notification every minute during the 10 minutes preceding the end of a reservation.

## Installation

Run the following if you haven't already:

    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

Install the gem:

    $ sudo gem install priteau-vizir

Vizir uses [RubyCocoa](http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/) to trigger Growl notifications.
RubyCocoa is shipped with Mac OS X 10.5, so it should work out of the box on Leopard.

## Advanced usage

You can even send push notifications to your iPhone using [Prowl](https://prowl.weks.net/).
No more nodes shutting down silently while you take a coffee break!
